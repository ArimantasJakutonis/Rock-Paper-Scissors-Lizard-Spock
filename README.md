# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
Codecademy challenge to create a rock paper scissors type game, but including 5 selections instead of 3.
This allowed me to used switch, break, if, else if functions.

User will choose out of 5 options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
After that, opponent will be randomised and winner is announced.

This is how they interact:

    Scissors cuts Paper.
    Paper covers Rock.
    Rock crushes Lizard.
    Lizard poisons Spock.
    Spock smashes Scissors.
    Scissors decapitate Lizard.
    Lizard eats Paper.
    Paper disproves Spock.
    Spock vaporizes Rock.
    (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.
